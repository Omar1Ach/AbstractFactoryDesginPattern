# Abstract Factory Design Pattern Example in C#

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Abstract Factory Design Pattern in C#. The code demonstrates how to use abstract factories to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Overview

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **Interfaces**:
  - `IAudioProcessor` and `IVideoProcessor` define methods for processing audio and video files.

- **Concrete Classes**:
  - `MP3Processor`, `MP4Processor`, `WAVProcessor`, and `AVIProcessor` provide actual implementations of audio and video processors.

- **Abstract Factory**:
  - `IMediaFactory` declares factory methods for creating audio and video processors.

- **Concrete Factories**:
  - `MP3MP4Factory` and `WAVAVIFactory` implement `IMediaFactory` to create specific types of audio and video processors.

- **Client Code**:
  - `MediaApplication` utilizes factories to create processors and processes audio and video files accordingly.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/abstract-factory-pattern-csharp.git`.
2. Open the project in your preferred C# IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, JetBrains Rider).
3. Explore the code to understand how the Abstract Factory pattern is implemented.
4. Run the `MediaApplication` class to see the pattern in action.
5. Modify or extend the code as needed for your own projects.
